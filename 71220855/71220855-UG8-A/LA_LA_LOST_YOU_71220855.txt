While I'm on Sunset, are you on the subway?
While I drive, are you gettin' on the L-train?
I mean, Manhattan's nice
But so are Malibu nights
You would know if you stayed
You would know if you put up a fight

Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red
Rum does the trick for all of the things left unsaid
I'm missin' our drunken 2 a.m. strolls in K-Town
Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side

And f- on Brooklyn's in Brooklyn
Your Chelsea's in Chelsea
Hope that eases the pain
So you remember to miss me
And you sold your car
Now you walk for miles
Bet your feet feel numb
Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight
